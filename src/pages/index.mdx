Stork is two things that work in tandem to put a beautiful, fast (10ms from keydown to repaint in the demo above), and accurate search interface on your static site. First, it's a program that indexes your content and writes that index to disk. Second, it's a Javascript library that downloads that index, hooks into a search input, and displays optimal search results immediately to your user, as they type.

Stork is built with Rust, and the Javascript library uses WebAssembly behind the scenes. It's built with content creators in mind, in that it requires little-to-no code to get started and can be extended deeply. It's perfect for JAMstack sites and personal blogs, but can be used wherever you need a search interface.

# Quick Start Guide

To begin, let's first embed the Federalist Paper search box in the demo above in a web page. Once that's working, we'll generate a new index with custom content and feed that into the search box.

## Embed the Federalist Paper Search

The demo above uses some custom CSS, but can generally be recreated with the following HTML:

<Wide>
  <Codeblock filename="index.html" lang="html">
    {`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Federalist Search</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://files.stork-search.net/basic.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="stork-wrapper">
      <input data-stork="federalist" class="stork-input" />
      <div data-stork="federalist-output" class="stork-output"></div>
    </div>
    <script src="https://files.stork-search.net/stork.js"></script>
    <script>
      stork.register(
        'federalist',
        'https://files.stork-search.net/federalist.st'
      )
    </script>
  </body>
</html>`}
  </Codeblock>
</Wide>

Putting that code in a new HTML page will get you a copy of the demo. In the rest of the section, I'll explain what's happening here.

### HTML Structure

Stork hooks into existing HTML that you include on your page. Each Stork instance has to have an **input element** and an **output element**, and generally Stork themes will ask you to put the input and output in a wrapper element.

<Codeblock lang="html">
  {`<div class="stork-wrapper">
  <input data-stork="federalist" />
  <div data-stork="federalist-output"></div>
</div>`}
</Codeblock>

Both the input and output elements will be registered under a certain name (here, that name is "federalist"). In your own code, replace `federalist` with a short name that describes your search index.

### Javascript

Right before the closing `</body>` tag, we include the Stork script and register the index.

<Codeblock lang="html">
  {`<script src="https://files.stork-search.net/stork.js"></script>
<script>
    stork.register(
        'federalist', 
        'https://files.stork-search.net/federalist.st'
    )
</script>`}
</Codeblock>

The `stork.register()` function takes two arguments: the name of your Stork instance, which must match the HTML attribute values; and the URL where the Stork index file can be found. Here, we're pointing to an index file I developed that searches through the contents of the Federalist Papers. Eventually, you'll build your own index, upload it to your web host, and point Stork at its URL instead.

### Theme

Stork is heavily customizable, and if you wanted, you could write CSS that makes the Stork output look exactly how you want. Alternatively, you can use one of the pre-existing themes to quickly spin up a polished look and feel for your search interface.

Here, we're using the Basic theme. The Basic theme comes with an HTML specification and a stylesheet. The `<input>` tag must have the `class="stork-input"` attribute, and the output div must have the `class="stork-output"` attribute. Finally, we link the Basic theme's stylesheet in our page's `<head>`:

<Codeblock lang="html">
  {`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://files.stork-search.net/basic.css" />`}
</Codeblock>

## Building your own index

Now that you have a search interface on a webpage, you can replace the Federalist Papers with your own content—I bet you're getting sick of searching for "liberty".

A Stork search index is built from a collection of sources, usually a set of files on your computer. When creating a search index, you create a **configuration file** that defines a list of sources and includes some metadata about each one. When you run the Stork command line application, Stork will build a search index based on the contents of those files and the specified metadata.

After you've [installed Stork](/docs), create a new file called `config.toml` near the documents you want to index, and add the following contents:

<Wide>
  <Codeblock filename="config.toml">
    {`[input]
base_directory = "my_files/"
files = [
    {path = "federalist-1.txt", url = "/federalist-1/", title = "Introduction"},
    {path = "federalist-2.txt", url = "/federalist-2/", title = "Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence"},
    {path = "federalist-3.txt", url = "/federalist-3/", title = "Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence 2"}
]
 
[output]
filename = "my_index.st"`}
  </Codeblock>
</Wide>

This [TOML file](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) defines the base directory of all your documents and an array of File maps. Each File map in the array describes:

- The path on disk where that file can be found, in relation to the base directory
- The URL to where that search result will link
- The title of the document

See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/config-ref) to see all the options you can add to the configuration file or to each File object.

To let you test your search index, Stork includes a demo web interface that automatically builds and loads your index from a configuration file. You can start the test interface via the command line:

```
$ stork --test config.toml
```

Opening `http://localhost:1612` in your browser will open the test interface. Here, you can test the search and adjust your index as necessary.

When you're ready, you can build the Stork index file with the command line tool:

```
$ stork --build config.toml
```

This will create a new file at `my_index.st`. This file is your search index, and contains the displayed results for the query your user inputs. The file should be uploaded to a public place, and its url should be passed into the `stork.register()` function.
