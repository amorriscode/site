# Installing Stork

There are two parts to Stork—the command line tool and the Javascript module—and both need to be installed separately.

## The command line tool

Today, there are four ways to install the command-line tool:

1. Installing with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (macOS):

  ```
  $ brew install stork-search/stork-tap/stork
  ```

2. Installing with [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/stork-search) (cross-platform):

  ```
  $ cargo install stork-search
  ```

3. Downloading the compiled binary (Ubuntu):

  ```
  $ wget https://files.stork-search.net/releases/latest/stork-ubuntu-latest
  $ chmod +x stork-ubuntu-latest
  ```

  This option is recommended in situations where you're automatically re-building an index file on a task runner. See [Stork and Netlify](/docs/stork-and-netlify) for an example.

4. Building from source (cross-platform):

  - Stork is built with Rust; make sure you have [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/) installed.
  - Download the [source code of the latest release](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases) (either the Zipfile or the Tarball), and uncompress it.
  - From the project directory, run `$ cargo build --release`
  - Run `./target/release/stork`, or copy the binary into your path

If none of these options work for you, or if you want Stork distributed elsewhere, [open a Github issue](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/issues/new) and let me know.

## The Javascript module

Today, there are two ways to install the Javascript module on your site:

### From the Stork CDN:

Include the following script tag on your site, before your closing `</body>` tag:

<Codeblock lang="html">
  {`<script src="https://files.stork-search.net/stork.js"></script>`}
</Codeblock>

This will load the most recent Stork module along with the matching WASM binary. It will make a `stork` global variable available.

### Self-hosting:

Download `stork.js` and `stork.wasm` from the [latest Github release](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases) and publish those files on your web server. Be sure to serve `stork.wasm` with the [correct MIME type](/docs/self-hosting), and be sure to call `stork.initialize()` with the URL of your WASM binary.

Visit the [self-hosting guide](/docs/self-hosting) for more information.

## Updates

Stork updates contain bug fixes, indexing enhancements, UI enhancements, and additional configuration options.

The project aims to keep all Stork artifacts evergreen; in other words, an index configuration file you write will generate a valid index in all future versions of Stork, and an index itself will be useable on all future versions of the Stork Javascript library. However, some new features will only work with an updated Stork setup, and some new features will require that you rebuild your search index.

To track updates, follow the [Stork Releases RSS feed](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases.atom).
