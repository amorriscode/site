There are two parts to Stork—the command line tool and the Javascript module—and both need to be installed separately.

# The command line tool

Today, there are four ways to install the command-line tool:

1. Installing with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (macOS):
  ```
  $ brew install stork-search/stork-tap/stork
  ```
2. Installing with [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/stork-search) (cross-platform):
  ```
  $ cargo install stork-search
  ```
3. Downloading the compiled binary (Ubuntu):
  ```
  $ wget https://files.stork-search.net/releases/latest/stork-ubuntu-latest
  $ chmod +x stork-ubuntu-latest
  ```

  This option is only recommended in situations where you're automatically re-building an index file on a task runner. See [Stork and Netlify](/docs/stork-and-netlify) for an example.
  
4. Building from source (cross-platform):
  - Stork is built with Rust; make sure you have [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/) installed.
  - Download the [source code of the latest release](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases) (either the Zipfile or the Tarball), and uncompress it.
  - From the project directory, run `$ cargo build --release`
  - Run `./target/release/stork`, or copy the binary into your path

If none of these options work for you, or if you want Stork distributed elsewhere, [open a Github issue](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/issues/new) and let me know.

# The Javascript module

The Javascript portion of Stork needs to be included with the following `<script>` tag, and (because the WebAssembly is dynamically loaded) shouldn't be packaged as part of a bundle, otherwise your search interface might unexpectedly break.

<Codeblock lang="html">
  {`<script src="https://files.stork-search.net/stork.js"></script>`}
</Codeblock>

Stork dynamically loads a WebAssembly binary, which is updated regularly with bugfixes, compatibility improvements, and features.

To track updates, follow the [Stork Releases RSS feed](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases.atom).
