There are two parts to Stork—the command line tool and the Javascript module—and both need to be installed separately.

# Installing with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

If you're on a Mac, you can use Homebrew to download Stork:

```
$ brew install jameslittle230/stork-tap/stork
```

The executable will be compiled and moved into your path.

# Building from source

If you're not on a Mac, or if you don't want to use Homebrew, you can manually install Stork.

* Stork is built with Rust; make sure you have [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/) installed.
* View the [latest release on Github](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/releases).
* Download the source code bundle (either the Zipfile or the Tarball) and uncompress it.
* From the project directory, run `$ cargo build --release`
* Optional: Copy the executable from `./target/release/stork` into your path
* Now when you run `$ stork` from your command line, you should see the project information and help text.

If this doesn't work for you, [open a Github issue](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/issues/new) and let me know.

# Embedding the script

The Javascript portion of Stork needs to be included with the following `<script>` tag, and shouldn't be packaged as part of a bundle.

<Codeblock lang="html">
  {`<script src="https://files.stork-search.net/stork.js"></script>`}
</Codeblock>

Stork dynamically loads a WebAssembly binary, which is updated regularly with bugfixes, compatibility improvements, and features.
