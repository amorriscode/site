To build a search interface that searches through your content, you first need to build an **index file** using the `stork` binary program that you [installed](/docs/install).

The index file is a static file that you serve on your web server or CDN. It contains precomputed search results for every possible search query; the Stork Javascript library queries this file to list out search results.

You likely want to rebuild and re-upload your search index every time your content changes so your search results stay up to date. If you [include Stork as a build step in your static site generator](/docs/stork-and-netlify), your search interface will be updated whenever your site is re-deployed.

# The Configuration File

To build an index file, you must tell Stork which documents you want to index. You do this by putting together a **configuration file** and passing it into the Stork binary program.

</div>

A basic Stork configuration defines a list of files to be indexed and a filename to which the computed index will be written:


<div className="popout">
  <Codeblock filename="basic.toml">
    {`[input]
base_directory = "my_files/"
files = [
    {path = "federalist-1.txt", url = "/federalist-1/", title = "Introduction"},
    {path = "federalist-2.txt", url = "/federalist-2/", title = "Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence"},
    {path = "federalist-3.txt", url = "/federalist-3/", title = "Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence 2"}
]
 
[output]
filename = "federalist.st"`}
  </Codeblock>
</div>

<div>

File paths in the config file are all relative to your **working directory when you run the Stork command**, including the base directory. For example, if you're in the `~/project/` directory when you run `$ stork --build basic.toml`, Stork will look for the files at:

- `~/project/my_files/federalist-1.txt`
- `~/project/my_files/federalist-2.txt`
- `~/project/my_files/federalist-3.txt`

and will output your index to `~/project/federalist.st`, regardless of the configuration file's path.

</div>

## <span class="badge">New in 1.0.0!</span> Testing your index 

You might want to test the search functionality of your index before publishing it online. Stork will let you test out your index in a simplified web interface, letting you quickly trial your configuration to make sure the search results are what you expect.

To test out your index, run:

```
$ stork --test basic.toml
```

and open `http://localhost:1612`, the web page served by Stork.

## TOML syntax oddities

TOML lets you describe arrays of objects in two ways. The first syntax, shown above, restricts each object to only be on one line. Alternatively, you can write your configuration file like this, where each entry in the `index.files` array is its own TOML block:

<div className="popout">
  <Codeblock filename="longer.toml">
    {`[input]
base_directory = "my_files"
url_prefix = "https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#"
 
[[input.files]] 
path = "federalist-1.txt"
url = "TheFederalistPapers-1"
title = "Introduction"
 
[[input.files]]
path = "federalist-2.txt"
url = "TheFederalistPapers-2"
title = "Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence"
 
[[input.files]]
path = "federalist-3.txt"
url = "TheFederalistPapers-3"
title = "Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence 2"
 
[output]
filename = "federalist.st"
`}
  </Codeblock>
</div>

You might prefer this syntax for more complicated configurations.

Notice that this configuration file also uses the `url_prefix` key to prefix each file's URL. This is useful if all your links are pointed to the same host (or, in this case, the same page, just with different anchors). All possible configuration options are outlined on the <Link to="/docs/config-ref">Configuration Reference docs page</Link> for more details.

# File Formats

Stork's north star implementation would let you bring your content in whatever format it exists, and Stork would be able to recognize and index it with no preprocessing needed. To build towards this goal, Stork will automatically recognize and extract text from four types of files: plain text, [SRT subtitle files](/docs/srt), HTML files and Markdown files.

Stork will automatically detect the file format using the file extension; however, if your file extension is non-standard, you can specify the format of any file:

```
[[input.files]]
path = "federalist-1.mdx"
url = "TheFederalistPapers-1"
title = "Introduction"
filetype = "Markdown"
```

By default, Stork will index all text in a file. However, in the configuration file, you can specify that your files have [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and Stork will ignore or parse that frontmatter for each file.

The `frontmatter_handling` key will control how Stork treats frontmatter throughout all files; the `Omit` value will parse and remove the frontmatter it finds:

```
[input]
base_directory = "my_files"
url_prefix = "https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#"
frontmatter_handling = "Omit"
files = [...]
```

You can also override frontmatter handling on a file-by-file basis; see the [Configuration File Reference](/docs/config-ref) for instructions.

# Additional Options

You can visit the [Configuration File Reference](/docs/config-ref) to see the full list of acceptable configuration key-value pairs.

The Stork configuration file lets you control many subtle aspects of how Stork indexes your content and how the search interface behaves, such as:

- Configure which language the stemmer uses to stem each word in your corpus
- Configure how important a word being in the document title is to its results ranking
- Configure how the content previews are displayed in the web interface
