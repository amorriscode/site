      Stork's aim is to be highly configurable. Search is a very site-specific
      piece of functionality, and it's important that the experience of
      searching feels like it belongs to your site, not to me, the Stork
      library, or anyone else. To that end, it's Stork's goal to let you
      configure how your files are indexed, how results are ordered, and how the
      search interface is displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two places where you can customize how Stork works: the build
      step, where you create your index file; and the run step, where you load
      the Stork library on your webpage and register your index file. This page
      will guide you through both sets of options and show you how to make your
      search bar your own.
